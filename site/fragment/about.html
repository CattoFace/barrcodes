<h1 id="title" class="title">About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an MSc student in Computer Science interested in distributed
computing, Rust, and high performance code in general.<br />
Almost everything I write, including this website, is free and open
source and can be found on my GitHub(link at the bottom of the
page).<br />
I don’t like using Generative AI for coding and there will likely be
barely any AI assisted code on this blog, if at all.</p>
