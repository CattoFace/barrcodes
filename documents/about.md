title: About Me

I'm an MSc student in Computer Science interested in distributed computing, Rust, and high performance code in general.  
Almost everything I write, including this website, is free and open source and can be found on my GitHub(link at the bottom of the page).  
I don't find Generative AI useful for coding and there will likely be barely any AI assisted code on this blog, if at all.
