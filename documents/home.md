# Welcome To My Blog
Just a website for me to publish random code
I like optimizing my code as much as possible(often more than necessary)
Past posts:
## [Exploding Pokemon As Fast As Possible](graveler-simulation)
Answering ShoddyCast's challenge by simulating 1 billion battles in ~1s.
## [Building a blog in 2024 with 50 lines of JavaScript](blog-building)
How I made this blog with no absolutely no frameworks(and a single dependency)
